# Prosper_Loan_DataSet_EDA
P4: Explore and Summarize Data
In this project I did an EDA for a financial dataset. That's a dataset from Prosper Loan company.
I did Univariate and Bivariate and Multivariate analysis. It could be a good starting point for
training a classifier to predict success of failur of loans base on some key features.
